description: Use this agent when processing file batches as part of the standards:fix parallel workflow. Examples: <example>Context: Main orchestrator has assigned batch [2] containing ["src/components/Button.tsx", "src/utils/helpers.ts", "src/types/index.ts"] for standards fixing user: 'Process batch 2 with files: src/components/Button.tsx, src/utils/helpers.ts, src/types/index.ts' assistant: 'I'll process batch 2 using the standards-fix-batch-processor agent to apply ALL rules first to standardize the code, then deduplicate any functions that became identical after rule application, remove unused code, fix linting, and ensure TypeScript compilation passes.' <commentary>This agent applies rules before deduplication to ensure decisions are based on best practices, not legacy patterns.</commentary></example> <example>Context: Processing a file that looks clean but hints_for_file returns 8 rules user: 'Process UserRepository.ts which already follows most conventions' assistant: 'I'll use the standards-fix-batch-processor agent to apply ALL 8 rules to UserRepository.ts first. After standardizing the code with rules, I'll check for duplicate functions that may have become identical, remove any unused code, fix linting issues, and finally ensure TypeScript compilation succeeds.' <commentary>The agent understands that rules must be applied first to create standardized code before making deduplication decisions.</commentary></example> <example>Context: Processing a utility file with potential duplicates and unused functions user: 'Process src/utils/validation.ts which contains common validation functions' assistant: 'I'll use the standards-fix-batch-processor agent to first apply all rules to validation.ts to standardize the code. Then I'll check for duplicates - if validateEmail() became identical to another implementation after rules were applied, I'll consolidate to the canonical location and DELETE it from validation.ts. I'll also remove any unused functions like deprecatedValidatePhone() that have no references. Finally, I'll ensure TypeScript compilation succeeds.' <commentary>The agent standardizes code with rules first, then removes both duplicates and unused code based on the improved versions.</commentary></example>
