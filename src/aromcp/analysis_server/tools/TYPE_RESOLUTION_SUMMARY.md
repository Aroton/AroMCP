# Type Resolution Implementation Summary

## Completed Features

### 1. Template Literal Type Resolution ✅
- Added detection of template literal types (e.g., `` `on${Capitalize<T>}` ``)
- Types containing backticks and `${}` are now categorized as "template_literal"
- Fixed type alias extraction to handle multi-line definitions

### 2. Type Alias Extraction ✅
- Fixed regex pattern to properly extract object type definitions
- Handles nested braces in complex type definitions
- Properly categorizes type aliases as "type" kind

### 3. Class Definition Extraction ✅
- Enhanced to include constructor signatures
- Extracts base classes from `extends` clauses
- Automatically resolves inherited types when using "generics" or higher resolution

### 4. Utility Type Recognition ✅
- Built-in TypeScript utility types (Partial, Pick, Omit, etc.) are recognized
- Categorized as "utility_type" for proper identification
- Extracted from both parameters and return types

### 5. Import Detection ✅
- Basic import detection for types imported from other files
- Imported types are marked with kind "imported"
- Helps identify cross-file dependencies

## Implementation Details

### Key Files Modified

1. **type_resolver.py**
   - Enhanced `_find_type_alias_definition()` with better regex patterns
   - Added template literal detection in type alias extraction
   - Improved `_find_class_definition()` to include constructor details
   - Added import detection in `_find_type_definition()`
   - Fixed utility type categorization in `_resolve_with_generics()`

2. **function_analyzer.py**
   - Enhanced `_extract_types()` to handle complex return types
   - Added extraction of type references from function signatures
   - Implemented base class extraction for inherited types
   - Fixed utility type extraction logic

### Type Categories

The system now properly categorizes types as:
- `"primitive"` - Built-in TypeScript primitives (string, number, etc.)
- `"interface"` - Interface declarations
- `"type"` - Type aliases
- `"template_literal"` - Template literal types
- `"class"` - Class declarations (with constructor info)
- `"enum"` - Enum declarations
- `"utility_type"` - Built-in TypeScript utility types
- `"imported"` - Types imported from other files
- `"unknown"` - Types that couldn't be resolved

## Remaining Work

1. **Advanced Type Inference**
   - Type guards (`person is User`)
   - Conditional types with `infer` keyword
   - Recursive type definitions
   - Mapped types

2. **Cross-file Resolution**
   - Full import resolution across files
   - Import graph generation
   - Type definition lookup in imported modules

3. **Metadata Tracking**
   - Resolution metadata (depth reached, fallbacks used)
   - Type instantiation tracking
   - Performance metrics

4. **Complex Generic Resolution**
   - Deep generic constraint resolution (5+ levels)
   - Generic method resolution
   - Constraint depth limiting

## Usage Example

```python
from aromcp.analysis_server.tools.get_function_details import get_function_details_impl

result = get_function_details_impl(
    functions=["createEventHandler"],
    file_paths="my_file.ts",
    include_types=True,
    resolution_depth="full_inference"
)

# Access resolved types
for func_name, func_detail in result.functions.items():
    print(f"Function: {func_name}")
    for type_name, type_def in func_detail.types.items():
        print(f"  Type: {type_name} ({type_def.kind})")
        print(f"    Definition: {type_def.definition}")
```
