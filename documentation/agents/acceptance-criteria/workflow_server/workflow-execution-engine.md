# Acceptance Criteria: Workflow Execution Engine
Generated: 2025-07-23
Source: Production workflow, schema.json, implementation analysis, test coverage review

## Overview
The workflow execution engine is the core orchestration component that manages workflow lifecycle, sequential step processing, and queue-based execution. It coordinates between different step types, manages workflow state transitions, and ensures proper execution order across complex workflows.

## Coverage Analysis
**Production Usage**: code-standards:enforce.yaml exercises sequential step processing, workflow lifecycle management, and queue-based execution through its 8-step validation workflow
**Current Test Coverage**: 
- `test_basic_execution.py` - sequential execution and lifecycle management
- `test_executor.py` - step processing order and queue management
- `test_batched_steps.py` - queue batching behavior
**Key Implementation Files**: 
- `src/aromcp/workflow_server/workflow/queue_executor.py` - main execution engine
- `src/aromcp/workflow_server/state/manager.py` - workflow lifecycle management
- `src/aromcp/workflow_server/workflow/models.py` - workflow data models
**Identified Gaps**: Missing comprehensive queue mode testing, workflow checkpoint/resume functionality

## Acceptance Criteria

### Feature: Sequential Step Processing

#### AC-WEE-001: Steps execute in defined order
**Given**: A workflow with multiple steps defined in sequence
**When**: The workflow is executed
**Then**: Steps must execute in the exact order defined in the workflow YAML

**Test Coverage**:
- ✓ Covered by: test_basic_execution.py::test_sequential_execution
- ✓ Covered by: test_executor.py::test_step_processing_order

**Implementation Reference**: src/aromcp/workflow_server/workflow/queue_executor.py:45-67

#### AC-WEE-002: Queue-based execution model maintains order
**Given**: Steps with different queue modes (batch, blocking, immediate, expand, wait)
**When**: Steps are queued for execution
**Then**: Queue priority and execution order must be maintained within each queue type

**Test Coverage**:
- ✓ Covered by: test_batched_steps.py::test_queue_batching_behavior
- ✗ Missing: Comprehensive queue mode testing for all queue types

**Implementation Reference**: src/aromcp/workflow_server/workflow/queue_executor.py:89-120

### Feature: Workflow Lifecycle Management

#### AC-WEE-003: Workflow state transitions are properly managed
**Given**: A new workflow instance
**When**: Lifecycle operations are performed (start, pause, resume, complete, fail)
**Then**: State transitions must be valid and tracked correctly

**Test Coverage**:
- ✓ Covered by: test_basic_execution.py::test_lifecycle_management
- ✓ Covered by: test_state_manager.py::test_state_transitions

**Implementation Reference**: src/aromcp/workflow_server/state/manager.py:78-102

#### AC-WEE-004: Unique workflow IDs are generated
**Given**: Multiple workflow instances are created
**When**: Each workflow is started
**Then**: Each workflow must receive a unique ID in format wf_[8-char-hex]

**Test Coverage**:
- ✓ Covered by: test_basic_execution.py::test_workflow_id_generation

**Implementation Reference**: src/aromcp/workflow_server/workflow/models.py:23-28

#### AC-WEE-005: Workflow pause and resume operations work correctly
**Given**: A running workflow
**When**: Pause and resume operations are called
**Then**: Workflow state must be preserved during pause and correctly restored on resume

**Test Coverage**:
- ✗ Missing: Comprehensive pause/resume functionality tests

**Implementation Reference**: src/aromcp/workflow_server/state/manager.py:145-178

---

### Feature: Queue-Based Execution Model

#### AC-WEE-006: User message steps are batched for efficiency
**Given**: Multiple consecutive user_message steps
**When**: Steps are processed
**Then**: Messages must be batched together for efficient client communication

**Test Coverage**:
- ✓ Covered by: test_batched_steps.py::test_user_message_batching

**Implementation Reference**: src/aromcp/workflow_server/workflow/queue_executor.py:203-225

#### AC-WEE-007: Blocking steps pause execution for client interaction
**Given**: A step requiring client interaction (user_input, wait_step)
**When**: The step is encountered
**Then**: Workflow execution must pause until client provides required input

**Test Coverage**:
- ✗ Missing: Blocking step behavior tests

**Implementation Reference**: src/aromcp/workflow_server/workflow/queue_executor.py:175-198

#### AC-WEE-008: Immediate processing for server-side steps
**Given**: Server-side steps (shell_command, control flow operations)
**When**: These steps are encountered
**Then**: They must execute immediately without queuing delays

**Test Coverage**:
- ✗ Missing: Immediate processing behavior tests

**Implementation Reference**: src/aromcp/workflow_server/workflow/queue_executor.py:140-165

---

### Feature: Workflow Progress Tracking

#### AC-WEE-009: Current step index and execution progress are tracked
**Given**: A workflow with multiple steps
**When**: The workflow executes
**Then**: Current step index and overall progress percentage must be accurately maintained

**Test Coverage**:
- ✓ Covered by: test_executor.py::test_progress_tracking

**Implementation Reference**: src/aromcp/workflow_server/workflow/models.py:45-52

#### AC-WEE-010: Execution context and metadata are maintained
**Given**: A workflow executing with various step types
**When**: Steps are processed
**Then**: Execution context (timestamps, step durations, error counts) must be tracked throughout the lifecycle

**Test Coverage**:
- ✗ Missing: Comprehensive execution context tracking tests

**Implementation Reference**: src/aromcp/workflow_server/workflow/models.py:67-85

## Integration Points
- **State Management**: Workflow engine coordinates with state manager for workflow state transitions
- **Step Processing**: Delegates individual step execution to step processors while maintaining overall coordination
- **Sub-Agent Management**: Coordinates with sub-agent manager for parallel_foreach step execution
- **Error Handling**: Integrates with error handling system for workflow-level error recovery

## Schema Compliance
Governed by workflow schema sections:
- `$.properties.steps` - Step definition array and execution order
- `$.properties.config.execution_mode` - Queue behavior configuration
- `$.properties.config.timeout_seconds` - Workflow-level timeout settings
