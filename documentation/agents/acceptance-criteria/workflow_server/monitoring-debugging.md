# Acceptance Criteria: Monitoring & Debugging
Generated: 2025-07-23
Source: Production workflow, schema.json, implementation analysis, test coverage review

## Overview
The monitoring and debugging system provides comprehensive workflow execution tracking, debug mode support, and observability features. It enables detailed execution tracing, performance monitoring, and enhanced debugging capabilities for workflow development and production troubleshooting.

## Coverage Analysis
**Production Usage**: code-standards:enforce.yaml exercises basic execution tracking but lacks comprehensive monitoring features - debug mode and advanced observability remain largely unused in production
**Current Test Coverage**: 
- `test_debug_tools.py` - debug functionality and tools
- `test_serial_debug_mode.py` - serial debug mode behavior
- `test_enhanced_diagnostics.py` - diagnostic information collection
**Key Implementation Files**: 
- `src/aromcp/workflow_server/debugging/debug_tools.py` - debug functionality coordination
- `src/aromcp/workflow_server/monitoring/execution_tracker.py` - execution monitoring
- `src/aromcp/workflow_server/debugging/serial_mode.py` - serial debug mode implementation
**Identified Gaps**: Missing comprehensive monitoring integration, performance profiling, production observability features
