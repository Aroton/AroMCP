# MCP Workflow System Implementation Plan - Phase 6: Advanced Features and Production

## Phase Overview
Complete the workflow system with advanced patterns, external integrations, and production deployment features. This phase transforms the system into a fully-featured workflow orchestration platform.

## Objectives
1. Implement advanced workflow patterns
2. Add event-driven capabilities
3. Enable external system integration
4. Support workflow versioning and migration
5. Production deployment readiness

## Components to Implement

### 1. Advanced Patterns (`src/aromcp/workflow_server/patterns/`)
```python
# dependency_graph.py
@dataclass
class DependencyGraph:
    tasks: dict[str, list[str]]  # task -> dependencies
    dynamic: bool = False
    priority_based: bool = False

# event_driven.py
@dataclass
class EventTrigger:
    event_type: str  # "file_change" | "schedule" | "webhook"
    filter: str | None
    workflow: str
    inputs_mapping: dict[str, str]
```

### 2. External Integrations (`src/aromcp/workflow_server/integrations/`)
- Webhook receiver for external triggers
- Event bus integration
- External state stores (Redis, S3)
- Notification systems
- Monitoring exports (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry)

### 3. Versioning System (`src/aromcp/workflow_server/versioning/`)
```python
@dataclass
class WorkflowVersion:
    version: str
    schema_version: int
    breaking_changes: list[str]
    migration_scripts: list[str]
    deprecated_features: list[str]
```

### 4. Production Features (`src/aromcp/workflow_server/production/`)
- Workflow packaging and distribution
- Hot reload capabilities
- Multi-tenant isolation
- Rate limiting and quotas
- Audit logging

### 5. Advanced MCP Tools
```python
@mcp.tool
@json_convert
def workflow_subscribe_events(
    event_pattern: str,
    workflow: str,
    filter: str | None = None
) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Subscribe workflow to events"""

@mcp.tool
@json_convert
def workflow_migrate(
    workflow_id: str,
    to_version: str,
    dry_run: bool = True
) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Migrate workflow to new version"""

@mcp.tool
@json_convert
def workflow_export(
    workflow: str,
    format: str = "yaml"  # "yaml" | "json" | "package"
) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Export workflow for distribution"""
```

## Risks and Mitigations
1. **Integration Complexity**
   - Risk: External system failures
   - Mitigation: Circuit breakers, fallbacks

2. **Version Compatibility**
   - Risk: Breaking changes disrupt workflows
   - Mitigation: Strict versioning, testing

3. **Multi-Tenant Security**

external_state:
  backend: "redis"
  config:
    url: "{{ env.REDIS_URL }}"
