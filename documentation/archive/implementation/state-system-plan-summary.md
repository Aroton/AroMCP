## Implementation Approach

### Core Principles
1. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start simple, add complexity incrementally
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests first, implement to pass
3. **Continuous Validation**: Verify against examples at each phase
4. **Production Focus**: Build for reliability and scale from the start

### Architecture Highlights
- **Reactive State Model**: Three-tier state with automatic transformations
- **MCP-Controlled Flow**: Server manages all workflow logic
- **Agent Simplicity**: Agents only execute atomic operations
- **Parallel Scalability**: Sub-agent delegation for concurrent work

## Phase Summary

- State read/write operations

**Key Deliverable**: Working state system with transformations

### Phase 2: Workflow Loading (3 weeks)
**Focus**: Basic workflow execution
- YAML workflow definitions
- Name-based loading system
- Sequential step execution
- Variable replacement

**Key Deliverable**: Simple workflows execute end-to-end

### Phase 3: Control Flow (3 weeks)
**Focus**: Complex workflow logic
- Conditional execution (if/then/else)
- Loop constructs (while, foreach)
- Expression evaluation
- User input handling

**Key Deliverable**: Complex workflows with logic

### Phase 4: Parallel Execution (3 weeks)
**Focus**: Scalable task distribution
- Parallel task delegation
- Sub-agent orchestration
- Concurrent state management
- Workflow composition

**Key Deliverable**: Multi-agent workflow execution

### Phase 5: Error Handling (3 weeks)
**Focus**: Production reliability
- Comprehensive error handling
- Retry mechanisms
- Debug tools
- Performance monitoring

**Key Deliverable**: Production-ready system

### Phase 6: Advanced Features (3 weeks)
**Focus**: Enterprise capabilities
- Complex dependency patterns
- Event-driven workflows
- External integrations
- Multi-tenant support

**Key Deliverable**: Full-featured platform

## Implementation Guidelines for Sonnet

### Starting Each Phase
1. Read the phase plan thoroughly
2. Review acceptance criteria
3. Set up test structure using TDD guide
4. Implement incrementally
5. Validate against examples

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks Addressed
1. **JavaScript Engine**: Start simple, consider fallbacks
2. **Concurrent State**: Proper locking, atomic operations
3. **Performance Scale**: Optimization from the start
4. **Error Scenarios**: Comprehensive handling
5. **Complex Logic**: Clear architectural boundaries

### Implementation Risks Addressed
1. **Scope Creep**: Phased approach with clear boundaries
2. **Quality Issues**: TDD and continuous testing
3. **Integration Problems**: Clear interfaces defined
4. **Documentation Gaps**: Maintained throughout

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Set up project structure** following the file organization in overview
2. **Create test files** using the TDD guide specifications
3. **Start Phase 1** with state models and transformation engine
4. **Validate continuously** against acceptance criteria
5. **Document progress** and any deviations from plan

## Conclusion

These implementation plans provide a comprehensive roadmap for building the MCP Workflow System. The phased approach ensures manageable scope, continuous validation, and progressive enhancement toward a production-ready solution.

The combination of detailed phase plans, TDD specifications, quick reference, and architectural overview gives implementers everything needed to successfully build this system while maintaining high quality standards throughout the process.
