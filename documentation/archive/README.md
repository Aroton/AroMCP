**Status**: ARCHIVED - Workflow server is now fully implemented  
**Purpose**: These were detailed implementation plans for the workflow server

- **state-system-*.md** - Comprehensive planning documents for workflow state management
- **prompts/** - Implementation and verification prompts for development phases  
- **state-examples/** - Example workflows and state transformations
- **workflow-server-completion-plan.md** - Final implementation roadmap

**Note**: The workflow server described in these documents has been successfully implemented and is available at `servers/workflow/main.py` with 12 production-ready tools.

## Why Archived

These documents served their purpose during the development phase but are no longer needed for:
- User documentation (see individual server READMEs)
- Development guidelines (see CLAUDE.md)
- Tool usage (see TOOL_GUIDE.md and TOOL_INVENTORY.md)

The actual implementation may differ from these planning documents as requirements evolved during development.
